### **📝 Project Description**

This project focuses on transforming messy, unorganized grocery/retail inventory data into a **structured, high-quality dataset** ready for analysis and reporting. The approach emphasizes practical data cleaning, organization, and visualization skills with complete **before-and-after proof** to validate the data quality improvements.

In short, we took data that looked like a toddler organized it and turned it into something an analyst can actually trust.
